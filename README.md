# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large, well-established company with a large base of employees that consist of baby boomers approaching retirement age. PH needs to narrow down the employees who meet the criteria for their retirement package from their large database. Identifying those who meet the criteria for retirement will help PH prepare and identify the positions that will need to be filled to keep their business running smoothly. Using SQL to query the expanse of existing employee data will help the HR department plan for the future and identify the departments in critical need of workers to replace the retirees. 


## Results

### Key Points
	* There are 1549 out of the 33,118 current employees that meet the eligibility requirements across all the positions within the company. Although this is a large number of people and the company will need to budget and plan accordingly, the retiring group only accounts for approximately 4.7% of their employees.
