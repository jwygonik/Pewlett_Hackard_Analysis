# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large, well-established company with a large base of employees that consist of baby boomers approaching retirement age. PH needs to narrow down the employees who meet the criteria for their retirement package from their large database. Identifying those who meet the criteria for retirement will help PH prepare and identify the positions that will need to be filled to keep their business running smoothly. Using SQL to query the expanse of existing employee data will help the HR department plan for the future and identify the departments in critical need of workers to replace the retirees. 


## Results

### Key Points
	* The Senior Engineers and Senior Staff will have the largest group of those retiring from the workforce. To plan for this upcoming deficit in leadership roles PH should make sure those in Senior positions and spending time training and identifying the employees in the roles below them are eligible for a promotion. If there are a lack of those in-house who are eligible to take on the Senior roles in the company, PH will have to do some serious recruiting in the job market to find experienced professionals to fill those roles.

	* If there are enough employees within the company to promote to Senior positions, PH will need to focus on ushering in a group of young professionals who are looking to learn and take on some of the less-experienced Staff and Assistant positions. 
	
	* There are 408 Senior Staff members eligible for the Retirement package, 396 Engineers, 316 Staff, and 298 Senior Engineers, this makes up the majority of those who meet the requirments for the retirement package. Because they are eligible for the benefits, these are the groups of employees that will most likely be the first to retire. Making sure PH is prepared to handle these deficits should be the first priority.

	* The largest group numbers of retirees by title is relatively proportionate to their concentration of current employees. 

## Summary

### Further Considerations
	
	* Although there are many more that are at retirement age, there are 1549 out of the 33,118 current employees that meet the benefits eligibility requirements across all the positions within the company. Those eligible for the retirement package make up 4.7% of their employees. With proper planning and budgeting, this should be manageable for the company. This process should be repeated on a yearly basis to allow the time and proper planning in case the eligibility groups are continue to grow larger. 
	
	* Because PH is such a large company, there are deep pockets of employees in most positions. With this in mind, PH should be have enough coverage to have their retiring employees mentor the upcoming leadership group. However, as they transfer more people to leadership positions, they will need to be prepared to hire and train some less-skilled workers for the lower level company positions.
