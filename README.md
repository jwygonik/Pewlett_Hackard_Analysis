# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large, well-established company with a large base of employees that consist of baby boomers approaching retirement age. PH needs to narrow down the employees who meet the criteria for their retirement package from their large database. Identifying those who meet the criteria for retirement will help PH prepare and identify the positions that will need to be filled to keep their business running smoothly. Using SQL to query the expanse of existing employee data will help the HR department plan for the future and identify the departments in critical need of workers to replace the retirees. 


## Results

### Key Points
	* The Senior Engineers and Senior Staff will have the largest group of those retiring from the workforce. To plan for this upcoming deficit in leadership roles PH should make sure those in Senior positions and spending time training and identifying the employees in the roles below them are eligible for a promotion. If there are a lack of those in-house who are eligible to take on the Senior roles in the company, PH will have to do some serious recruiting in the job market to find experienced professionals to fill those roles. 

	* If there are enough employees within the company to promote to Senior positions, PH will need to focus on ushering in a group of young professionals who are looking to learn and take on some of the less-experienced Staff and Assistant positions.

## Summary

### Further Considerations
	
	* There are 1549 out of the 33,118 current employees that meet the eligibility requirements across all the positions within the company. Those eligible for the retirement package make up 4.7% of their employees. With proper planning and budgeting, this should be manageable for the company.
